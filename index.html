    <b><h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2></b>
<p>About me:</p>
<p>First and foremost: my wife is the most important loved one in the world to me. My dog is the second. They are the biggest part of my life and nothing can change that.</p>
<p>My original qualifications are as a Cad-Cam technician and Cnc operator, where precision and attention to detail were paramount. However, my journey took an exciting turn when I decided to delve into the world of coding.</p>
<p>Over the years, while working at various companies, I had the privilege of gaining insights into coding from friends who had formal education in programming. My curiosity about the world of coding grew and I embarked on a self-driven journey of learning and exploration.</p>
<p>This journey has been truly transformative. I initially immersed myself in C#, a versatile and powerful language, before venturing into the realm of Java. My curiosity didn't stop there; I delved into databases, honed my skills in HTML and CSS, and even dabbled in JavaScript.</p>
<p>What sets me apart is not only my ability to solve real-world challenges using coding but also my deep understanding and application of fundamental programming principles. I firmly grasp object-oriented programming (OOP) methodologies and concepts, allowing me to design modular, scalable, and maintainable solutions.</p>
<p>My commitment to writing clean, elegant, and maintainable code is unwavering. I firmly believe that clean code is not just a practice; it's a mindset that enhances collaboration, ensures readability, and minimizes technical debt.</p>
<p>Now, after successfully crafting desktop applications to solve workplace challenges, I stand at a pivotal juncture. It's time to channel my passion for coding into a fulfilling career where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.</p>
<p>As I step forward in my coding journey, I am excited about the prospects of joining a team where I can leverage my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and keep refining my craft.</p>

    <p>This is a very simple music player desktop application I created using WPF. The program is fairly straightforward and its only function is to</p>
    <p>load, play, pause and stop playing music tracks. Its has very low memory consumption which was the goal.</p>

    <p>Finances app that tracks incomes and spendings and calculates their sum accordingly. Also saves data into a Json file.</p>
    <p>Its far from an internet bank, but still quite usable.</p>

    <p>Its my first try at building an API. Spent like an hour fixing errors here and there but finally Postman gave me proper</p>
    <p>returned information about the Post call. It only stores in/retrieves data from memory, but a database is only a small step from here.</p>
